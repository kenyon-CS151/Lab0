# Lab 0 -- Getting Started with Python, PyCharm, and GitHub
10 points										
Due: 

## Purpose:  

This assignment is aimed at giving you experience with the lab environment, with pair programming, using the Interactive Development Environment (IDE) [PyCharm], and writing, debugging, and running a simple Python program.

## Problem: 

Write a program that introduces you and your partner to the class (this information will be shared). 

### Details: 

You will write your program in the “pair programming” mode -- one of you is the driver while the other is the navigator.  Once the first driver has written the statements about their partner, switch roles. The steps below match the tutorial, and the GitHub Quick Guide on Moodle. You may need to reference both.

### Steps:

1.	CLONE REPOSITORY: Open PyCharm and follow the steps in the “GitHub Quick Guide” document for “Starting an Assignment” to create and clone your Lab0 repository. The Quick Guide document is on Moodle under “General Resources”.

2.	START FILE: There are no files in your repository yet. In PyCharm, in order to create a new Python source code file, be sure you have the Lab 0 folder highlighted in the left side frame tool window. Then, right-click this folder and choose New->Python File from the available menu. Name your new file “Lab0.py” and click “OK.” If you are asked if you want to add the file to Git, click “Yes.” However, don't click yes to adding any other file it asks you about -- only click "yes" about the file you just created.

3.	CODE: Write code in your Lab0.py file. First type  `print ("CS151 Lab 0")` into the file, like in the video you watched yesterday.

4.	RUN: Run your program by clicking on the “Run” menu, then choosing “Run” from the drop down menu. Note that once you complete this step once, you can instead click on the green arrow at the top right.

5.	TEST: Look at the output at the bottom of PyCharm. Does it appear the way you want? If not, or if instead you see an error, try to fix your code so that it does what you want (you will need to run again afterward).

6.	COMPLETE LAB: Now, write code to output 5 statements about each lab partner so that they also appear at the bottom of PyCharm when the file is run. 
  * Before the 5 statements, output the name of the person who is about to be described. 
  * Try to be creative in your statements. 
  * Take turns driving -- the driver should write statements about their partner, then switch roles. 
  * You will have to run and test again to make sure it works. Warning -- you should save often as you code. If your computer or PyCharm crashes and you haven’t saved your work, it’s lost forever! File->Save All will save your work.

7.	COMMENT: Comments are part of the Python file but not part of the code. They are used to explain how the code works to human readers of the code.  Once your program runs properly, add introductory comments at the top of your file that match the ones below but are edited to be personalized to you and your partner (replace the brackets and the text in the brackets with what the text in the brackets asks for). The comments will appear as a different color in PyCharm (light grey). Make sure the program runs correctly after the comments are inserted.
  ```
  # Programmers:  [your name here]
  # Course:  CS151, Dr. Kenyon
  # Date: 1/21/22
  # Lab Assignment: 0
  # Problem Statement:  [what problem does your code solve; what does the code do for you?]
  # Data In: [what information do you request from the user? – for Lab0, put “None”]
  # Data Out:  [What information do you display for the user?]
  # Other files needed:  [This won’t be relevant until later in the course.]
  # Credits: [Is your code based on an example in the book, in class, or something else?  
              Reminder: you should never take code from the Internet or another person.]
  ```
8.	Once you are done in lab, even if you haven’t finished the assignment yet, you need to Commit and Push your changes. Follow the directions in the “GitHub Quick Guide” document for “Saving Your Work.”

9. Show your program running and on GitHub to the professor before leaving the classroom.

What to Submit:

1.	Commit & Push your repository to GitHub. Go to GitHub.com to check that it worked. (1 file per pair)
2.	Each partner should independently write a short (around 200 words) reflection of what they learned in Lab 0, and what it was like working with their partner. Submit to Moodle under the Lab0 assignment.
