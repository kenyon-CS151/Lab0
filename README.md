#Lab 0 -- Getting Started with Python, PyCharm, and GitHub
Due: Friday 09/10/21, at class time

Purpose:  This assignment is aimed at giving you experience with the lab environment, with pair programming, using the Interactive Development Environment (IDE) [PyCharm], and writing, debugging, and running a simple Python program.

Problem: Write a program that introduces you and your partner to each other. 

Details: You will write your program in the "pair programmingù model": one of you is the driver while the other is the navigator.  Once the first driver has written the statements about their partner, switch roles. The steps below match the tutorial you watched before lab, and the GitHub Quick Guide on Moodle. You may need to reference both.

1.	OPEN PyCharm.

2.	START FILE: There is no start file for this lab. In PyCharm, in order to create a new Python source code file, choose New->Project, then New->Python File from the available menu. Name your new file LastName1LastName2Lab0ù and click OK.ù 

3.	CODE: Write code in your LastName1LastName2Lab0.py file. First type   
print( "CS151 Lab 0")
inside the file.

4.	RUN: Run your program by clicking on the Runù menu, then choosing Runù from the drop down menu. Note that once you complete this step once, you can instead click on the green arrow at the top right.

5.	TEST: Look at the output at the bottom of PyCharm. Does it appear the way you want? If not, or if instead you see an error, try to fix your code so that it does what you want (you will need to run again afterward).

6.	COMPLETE LAB: Now, write 5 statements about each lab partner so that they also appear at the bottom of PyCharm when the file is run (and each group of 5 statements should be separated by a blank line in the output). 
  * Before the 5 statements, state the name of the person who is about to be described. 
  * Try to be creative in your statements. 
  * Take turns driving: the driver should write statements about their partner, then switch roles. 
  * You will have to run and test again to make sure it works. Warning: you should save often as you code. If your computer or PyCharm crashes and you haven't saved your work, it's lost forever! File->Save All will save your work.

7.	COMMENT: Comments are part of the Python file but not part of the code. They are used to explain how the code works to human readers of the code.  Once your program runs properly, add introductory comments at the top of your file that match the ones below but are edited to be personalized to you and your partner. The comments will appear as a different color in PyCharm (light grey). Make sure the program runs correctly after the comments are inserted.
  
  # Programmers:  [your name here]
  # Course:  CS151.01, Professor Franceschi
  # Date: [today's date]
  # Lab Assignment:  [number of assignment]
  # Problem Statement:  [what problem does your code solve; what does the code do for you?]
  # Data In: [what information do you request from the user? for Lab0, put Noneù]
  # Data Out:  [What information do you display for the user?]
  # Other files needed:  [This won't be relevant until later in the course.]
  # Credits: [Is your code based on an example in the book, in class, or something else?  

Reminder: you should never take code from the Internet or another person.]
  
8.	Once you are done in lab, you need to upload it to Moodle.

9. Show your program running and on Moodle to the professor before leaving the classroom.

What to Submit:

1.	Post your Python file on Moodle. (only 1 file per pair)
2.	Print out a copy of your completed python file and turn in during class (only one per pair). Remember that you can open your Python file on a computer that doesn't have PyCharm in a text editor like Notepad or Notepad++.
